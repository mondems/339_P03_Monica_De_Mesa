      <h2 class="header2">About The Film</h2>
      <p>



It Doesnâ€™t Whisper Anymore is a short film about a girl who undergoes awareness of her self perception and works towards accepting who she is. As she explores her surroundings she uses the environment as a way to reflect on herself.

The film was created for a project in my Narrative and New Media class at SFU in collaboration with Sahar Babaei. For this project we had to produce a 1 to 3 minute video-based linear narrative. In order to score an A+ for the project which my team achieved, it was expected to create a compelling and original overall concept. As well, it was important to develop vivid characters and create a narrative that strongly supports linear engagement.</p>

<h2 class="header2">The Creation Process</h2>
<p>When creating the character for this short film I knew that in order to create an interesting and compelling character, the character would need to undergo a distinct change from start to finish. In order to establish this distinct change, I brainstormed paired traits, that would illustrate a transformation that is distinct yet believable. </p>

<p>For the project I collaborated with my teammate in refining the final script and was in charge of the initial writing stage. In the film the character reflects on her thoughts by journaling and her journal entry is the basis of the script. Because I wanted the delivery of the character's dialogue to be authentic to her personality and character design I did a journaling exercise. I kept the character design and traits I had established in mind and wrote multiple journal entries, as if I was the character.</p>

<p>
The process of journaling before script writing helped to inspire authenticity to the character in the final script. Because the journal exercise forced me to explore the thoughts and mindset that the character I developed has, I was able to continue to think like the character and write a script, that reflects authenticity to the character and is more focused on the narrative of the film. </p>

<p>Once the initial draft of the script was written, I had a meeting with my teammate for a read through of the script to get her opinion on what could be improved and revised. We then collaborated to revise the script for its final form. </p>

<p>In the film the character observes the people and things around her. Her observation of her surroundings is a big part of the narrative, so in order to illustrate this I filmed the footage while walking around Vancouver on a Canon Vixia camcorder. I shot anything or anybody that the character may be inclined to observe. My team chose to shoot some of the footage with a camcorder to allow the audience to experience the character's point of view. </p>

<p>In addition to filming on a camcorder, I also filmed footage on a Canon M50. Although the film shows the audience the character's point of view, we still wanted to give the audience an idea of what the character looks like before revealing her face in the end of the film. Therefore, I shot the footage of our character on a Canon M50 to distinguish between the point of view shots and the shots of the character. </p>

<p>For the project I collaborated with my teammate in directing according to the storyboard to ensure our actress was reflecting the character we wanted to portray. Although I was directing the actress as to what expressions or movements were needed for each scene, we did sometimes have to do multiple takes for a scene. This process of directing helped me to learn that sometimes the initial vision has to be refined or adjusted to be its best for the scene. </p>

<p>I was in charge of editing the final sequence of the film which took some time as I looked through all our footage to find the best clips that worked for the sequence. I made use of Adobe's Premiere Pro and colour corrected the footage as well. A main part of the film is to provide the audience with insight to the character's thoughts and my focus on this created a challenge with giving the audience a visual of the character's appearance. To combat this challenge I made sure to carefully incorporate footage that shows the character in a way that complimented the sequence. </p>

<p>The creation of this project allowed me to experiment with mixing and contrasting footage between the Canon M50 and Canon Vixia camcorder. Through this project I was able to learn how to make use of contrasting footage to my advantage in a way that supports the narrative. The differing aesthetics became a key tool to tell the story. As well, the process of this project has helped me to see the importance in creating steps to think like the character in order to support the delivery of the character in the final film. </p>
